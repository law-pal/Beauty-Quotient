#This project is my first full-stack application here is the deploy link => https://law-pal.github.io/Beauty-Quotient/


#Links of my backend deploy in heroku => http://heroku-beauty-quotient.herokuapp.com/beauty_api/v1/users



I started this project by planning the page layout, I decided to go with a grid container for all my content is a very simple layout "header", "main", "footer"
from there I designed a UI friendly navigation bar to make the user navigate thru the site easy and able to find things quick, is a navigation component with four links home, shopping bag , products (where I created a dropdown menu), contact us page and sign up form, I utilized Redux to managed the state and connect to the store to pass props to the components where I needed data, Fetching utilizing async functions and utilizing 3rd party API, Also using React-Router to handle all my routes and connecting to my backend when the user sign up for the page performing 'PUT', 'POST methods.
I realize there's a lot of work to do when bulding a fullstack application if you try to implement something you have to take in consideration other things a lot of thing I didn't know I messed up but  I was able to fix them I definetly have few things to add and continue to work on especially on mobile mode making sure thing display correctly, overall it's been a fun expierence from here the sky is the limit buildind applications. 
Briefly for the backend part of this project I use spring boot app and postgreSQL for mt database fully CRUD functionality both React is conncted to the datebase.
Thanks.











This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
